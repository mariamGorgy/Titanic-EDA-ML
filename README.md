# Titanic-EDA-ML

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models. It includes data cleaning, visualization, statistical testing, and predictive modeling using logistic regression and decision trees.

  Project Overview

-  Dataset:  Titanic dataset from Kaggle
-  Goal:  Predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster
-  Techniques used: 
  - EDA with seaborn and matplotlib
  - Outlier detection using Tukey's method
  - Statistical testing: Chi-square, T-test, ANOVA
  - One-hot encoding and feature scaling
  - Model training: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
  - Performance comparison

  Model Results

-  Logistic Regression: 
  - Accuracy: 81% (test)
-  Decision Tree: 
  - Accuracy: 80% (test)
-  Linear Regression & Regression Tree  used for Fare prediction

  How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells in order
3. Review visualizations and model results
